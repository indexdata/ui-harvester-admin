To build and deploy a new stripes bundle that includes the latest from the main/master branch of ui-harvester-admin, run [the `bundle-deploy` workflow on the main branch of `platform-harvester-dev`](https://github.com/indexdata/platform-harvester-dev/actions/workflows/bundle-deploy.yml). That will build the stripes bundle with the latest changes on the `main` branch of `ui-harvester-admin` included.

If you have permission changes or MD changes,  youâ€™ll need to post it to Okapi and enable the MD for the tenant.
